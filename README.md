Welcome to my Python Programming Internship Repository with CODSOFT! This is where I've documented and shared the code and projects I worked on during my internship. Explore the world of Python development with me and discover the exciting work I've accomplished during this learning journey. i have put together a collection of my Python projects. Dive into the code that fueled my growth as a Python developer and discover the skills I've honed in data analysis, web development, and more. Join me on this exciting coding expedition! #CODSOFT


TASK 1(to-do-list application)
For this task, i Created a full-featured To-Do list application, i used the Tkinter library in creating a code that provides a basic command-line interface for creating, viewing, and completing tasks. The Tkinter library offered tools for creating windows, buttons, and other GUI elements, making it easier to build an interactive application.
I created an empty list, defined a function to add a particular task to the list, a function to view all tasks, another function to mark task as completed then created a main loop.

TASK 2(calculator)
I simply started by creating a function to perform addition, followed by a function to perform subtraction, a funtion to perform multiplication and lastly a function to perform division. put together functions that would get user inputs then display results.

TASK 3(password generator)
I imported random and string, created a function to generate a random password then proceed to get user input for the password length and complexity, which will prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password and the complexity level. Depending on the complexity level chosen (1 for letters, 2 for letters and numbers, 3 for letters, numbers, and special characters), it will generate and display a random password of the specified lengthafter which it generates the password.

TASK 4(quiz game)
The first step was to load Quiz Questions, i stored them in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a question with keys like "question", "options", and "correct_answer".
The next step was to Calculate the Final Score and Keep track of the user's score as they answer questions.
Display Welcome Message and explain the rules to the user then Present Quiz Questions: here i chose to Iterate through my list of questions and present each question along with answer choices to the user.
Prompt the User to Select an Answer, and made Use of input() to get the user's answer choice.
Evaluate the User's Answer by Comparing the user's answer with the correct answer and update the user's score accordingly.
Provide Feedback, by displaying if the answer was correct or incorrect. Show the correct answer for incorrect responses.
Calculate the Final Score: Keep track of the user's score throughout the quiz.
Display Final Results and Print the user's score and a performance message.
Ask the user if they want to play again.
